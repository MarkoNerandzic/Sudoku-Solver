The program processes the puzzle by first reading from a file called sudokuInput.txt . In order to have the SudokuSolver solve your own puzzle, you simply need to copy the puzzle into the sudokuInput.txt file. Each line represents a row and each character represents a cell in sudokuInput.txt . Writing each number normally, insert a space for each blank cell, and enter a new line when inserting a new row, to input your puzzle.
